Problem description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The goal is to segment and identify automatically mitochondria instances in EM images. To solve such task pairs of EM images and their corresponding instance segmentation labels are provided. Below a pair example is depicted:

.. list-table::

  * - .. figure:: ../img/mitoem_crop.png
         :align: center

         MitoEM-H tissue image sample. 

    - .. figure:: ../img/mitoem_crop_mask.png
         :align: center

         Its corresponding instance mask.

MitoEM dataset is composed by two EM volumes from human and rat cortices, named MitoEM-H and MitoEM-R respectively. Each 
volume has a size of ``(1000,4096,4096)`` voxels, for ``(z,x,y)`` axes. They are divided in ``(500,4096,4096)`` for
train, ``(100,4096,4096)`` for validation and ``(500,4096,4096)`` for test. Both tissues contain multiple instances
entangling with each other with unclear boundaries and complex morphology, e.g., (a) mitochondria-on-a-string (MOAS)
instances are connected by thin microtubules, and (b) multiple instances can entangle with each other.

Data preparation                                                                                                        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                                        
       
You need to download MitoEM dataset first:

* **MitoEM-H**: `EM images <https://www.dropbox.com/s/z41qtu4y735j95e/EM30-H-im.zip?dl=0>`__ and `labels <https://www.dropbox.com/s/dhf89bc14kemw4e/EM30-H-mito-train-val-v2.zip?dl=0>`__. 

* **MitoEM-R**: `EM images <https://www.dropbox.com/s/kobmxbrabdfkx7y/EM30-R-im.zip?dl=0>`__ and `labels <https://www.dropbox.com/s/stncdytayhr8ggz/EM30-R-mito-train-val-v2.zip?dl=0>`__.

The EM images should be ``1000`` on each case while labels only ``500`` are available. The partition should be as follows:

* Training data is composed by ``400`` images, i.e. EM images and labels in ``[0-399]`` range. These labels are separated in a folder called ``mito-train-v2``.
* Validation data is composed by ``100`` images, i.e. EM images and labels in ``[400-499]`` range. These labels are separated in a folder called ``mito-val-v2``.
* Test data is composed by ``500`` images, i.e. EM images in ``[500-999]`` range. 

Once you have donwloaded this data you need to create a directory tree as described in :ref:`instance_segmentation_data_prep`. 

                                                                                                                 
Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reproduce the exact results of our manuscript you need to use `mitoem.yaml <https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy/blob/master/templates/instance_segmentation/MitoEM_paper/mitoem.yaml>`__ configuration file.  

Then you need to modify ``TRAIN.PATH`` and ``TRAIN.MASK_PATH`` with your training data path of EM images and labels respectively. In the same way, do it for the validation data with ``VAL.PATH`` and ``VAL.MASK_PATH`` and for the test setting ``TEST.PATH``. 

Run
~~~

To run it via **command line** or **Docker** you can follow the same steps as decribed in :ref:`instance_segmentation_run`. 

Results
~~~~~~~

The results follow same structure as explained in :ref:`instance_segmentation_results`. The results should be something like the following:

.. list-table::

  * - .. figure:: ../img/mitoem_crop_mask.png
         :align: center

         MitoEM-H train sample's GT.

    - .. figure:: ../img/mitoem_pred.png
         :align: center

         MitoEM-H train prediction.

MitoEM challenge submission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a open challenge for MitoEM dataset: https://mitoem.grand-challenge.org/

To prepare ``.h5`` files from resulting instance predictions in ``.tif`` format you can use the script `tif_to_h5.py <https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy/blob/master/utils/scripts/tif_to_h5.py>`_. The instances of both Human and Rat tissue need to be provided 
(files must be named as ``0_human_instance_seg_pred.h5`` and ``1_rat_instance_seg_pred.h5`` respectively). Find the full
details in the `challenge's evaluation page <https://mitoem.grand-challenge.org/Evaluation/>`__.
