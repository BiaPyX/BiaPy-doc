.. _semantic_segmentation:

Semantic segmentation
---------------------

The goal of this workflow is assign a class to each pixel of the input image. 

* **Input:** 
    * Image. 
    * Class mask where each pixel is labeled with an integer representing a class.
* **Output:**
    * Image with the probability of being part of each class.  

In the figure below an example of this workflow's **input** is depicted. There, only two labels are present in the mask: black pixels, with value 0, represent the background and white ones the mitochondria, labeled with 1. The number of classes is defined by ``MODEL.N_CLASSES`` variable.

.. list-table:: 

  * - .. figure:: ../img/FIBSEM_test_0.png
         :align: center

         Input image.

    - .. figure:: ../img/FIBSEM_test_0_gt.png
         :align: center

         Input class mask (ground truth).

The **output** in case that only two classes are present, as in this example, will be an image where each pixel will have the probability of being of class 1. 

If there are **3 or more classes**, the output will be a multi-channel image, with the same number of channels as classes, and the same pixel in each channel will be the probability (in ``[0-1]`` range) of being of the class that represents that channel number. For instance, with 3 classes, e.g. background, mitochondria and contours, the fist channel will represent background, the second mitochondria and the last contour class.

Data preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure the proper operation of the library the data directory tree should be something like this: ::

    dataset/
    ├── train
    │   ├── x
    │   │   ├── training-0001.tif
    │   │   ├── training-0002.tif
    │   │   ├── . . .
    │   │   ├── training-9999.tif
    │   └── y
    │       ├── training_groundtruth-0001.tif
    │       ├── training_groundtruth-0002.tif
    │       ├── . . .
    │       ├── training_groundtruth-9999.tif
    └── test
        ├── x
        │   ├── testing-0001.tif
        │   ├── testing-0002.tif
        │   ├── . . .
        │   ├── testing-9999.tif
        └── y
            ├── testing_groundtruth-0001.tif
            ├── testing_groundtruth-0002.tif
            ├── . . .
            ├── testing_groundtruth-9999.tif

.. warning:: Ensure that images and their corresponding masks are sorted in the same way. A common approach is to fill with zeros the image number added to the filenames (as in the example). 

Configuration                                                                                                                 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find in `templates/semantic_segmentation <https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy/tree/master/templates/semantic_segmentation>`__ folder of BiaPy a few YAML configuration templates for this workflow. 


Special workflow configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here some special configuration options that can be selected in this workflow are described:

* **Data loading**: if you want to select ``DATA.EXTRACT_RANDOM_PATCH`` you can also set ``DATA.PROBABILITY_MAP`` to create a probability map so the patches extracted will have a high probability of having an object in the middle of it. Useful to avoid extracting patches which no foreground class information. That map will be saved in ``PATHS.PROB_MAP_DIR``.

Furthermore, when this is enabled, in ``PATHS.DA_SAMPLES`` path, i.e. ``aug`` folder by default (see :ref:`semantic_segmentation_results`), two more images will be created so you can check how this probability map is working. These images will have painted a blue square and a red point in its middle, which correspond to the patch area extracted and the central point selected respectively. One image will be named as ``mark_x`` and the other one as ``mark_y``, which correspond to the input image and ground truth respectively.  

* **Metrics**: during the inference phase the performance of the test data is measured using different metrics if test masks were provided (i.e. ground truth) and, consequently, ``DATA.TEST.LOAD_GT`` is enabled. In the case of semantic segmentation the **Intersection over Union** (IoU) metrics is calculated. This metric, also referred as the Jaccard index, is essentially a method to quantify the percent of overlap between the target mask and the prediction output. Depending on the configuration different values are calculated (as explained in :ref:`_config_test`). This values can vary a lot as stated in :cite:p:`Franco-Barranco2021`.

    * ``per patch`` values are calculated if ``TEST.STATS.PER_PATCH`` is enabled. IoU is calculated for each patch separately and then averaged. 
    * ``merge patches`` values are calculated if ``TEST.STATS.MERGE_PATCHES`` is enabled. Notice that depending on the amount of overlap/padding selected the merged image can be different than just concatenating each patch. 
    * ``full image`` values are calculated if ``TEST.STATS.FULL_IMG`` is enabled. This can be done if the model selected if fully convolutional. The results may be slightly different from ``merge patches`` as you may notice and probably no border effect will be seen. 

* **Post-processing**: When ``PROBLEM.NDIM`` is ``2D`` the post-processing will be enabled only if ``TEST.STATS.FULL_IMG`` is enabled. In that case the post-processing will process all 2D predicted images as a unique 3D stack. On the other hand, when ``PROBLEM.NDIM`` is ``3D`` the post-processing will be applied when ``TEST.STATS.PER_PATCH`` and ``TEST.STATS.MERGE_PATCHES`` is selected. In this case, each 3D predicted image will be processed individually.

    * **Z-filtering**: to apply a median filtering in ``z`` axis. Useful to maintain class coherence across 3D volumes. Enable it with ``TEST.POST_PROCESSING.Z_FILTERING`` and use ``TEST.POST_PROCESSING.Z_FILTERING_SIZE`` for the size of the median filter. 

    * **YZ-filtering**: to apply a median filtering in ``y`` and ``z`` axes. Useful to maintain class coherence across 3D volumes that can work slightly better than ``Z-filtering``. Enable it with ``TEST.POST_PROCESSING.YZ_FILTERING`` and use ``TEST.POST_PROCESSING.YZ_FILTERING_SIZE`` for the size of the median filter.

Following the example, you should see that the directory ``/home/user/exp_results/resunet_2d`` has been created. If the same experiment is run 5 times, varying ``--run_id`` argument only, you should find the following directory tree: ::

.. note::
