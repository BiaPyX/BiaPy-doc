There are several options available for executing BiaPy, namely GUI mode, utilizing Jupyter notebooks, deploying it via Docker, or employing the command-line interface (each of which demands varying levels of expertise). Once you have determined the **execution method** that aligns best with your proficiency, proceed by following the subsequent steps:

* Follow the `installation steps <installation.html>`_ to use BiaPy.

* `Select the specific workflow <select_workflow.html>`_ that aligns with your intended use.

* Refer to the workflow-specific execution instructions (located in the "Run" section of each workflow page) corresponding to the chosen **execution method**.

For a more in-depth understanding of the functioning of BiaPy, you can delve into the `How it works <how_it_works.html>`_ and `Configuration <configuration.html>`_ sections. Similarly, if you encounter any challenges while running BiaPy, please consult the `FAQ <faq.html>`_ section for assistance.

In the "TUTORIAL" section, you can locate the official tutorial designed to replicate the tasks accomplished in all the projects utilizing BiaPy.

For a comprehensive guide on the procedures to follow if you wish to contribute or develop your own code based on BiaPy, please refer to the "HOW TO CONTRIBUTE" tab.
