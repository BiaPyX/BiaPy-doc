There are several options available for executing BiaPy, namely GUI mode, utilizing Jupyter notebooks, deploying it via Docker, or employing the command-line interface (each of which demands varying levels of expertise).

Once you have determined the **execution method** that aligns best with your computational expertise or preference, proceed by following the subsequent steps:

1. Follow the `installation steps <installation.html>`__ to install BiaPy.

2. `Select the specific workflow <select_workflow.html>`__ intended use.

3. Refer to the workflow-specific execution instructions (located in the "How to run" section of each workflow configuration page) corresponding to the chosen **execution method**.

For a more in-depth understanding of BiaPy functioning, visit the `"How it works" <how_it_works.html>`__ and `"Configuration" <configuration.html>`__ sections. Similarly, if you encounter any challenges while running BiaPy, please consult the `FAQ & Troubleshooting <faq.html>`__ section for assistance.

The **TUTORIALS** section is populated with detailed tutorials designed to replicate the tasks accomplished in all the projects where different BiaPy workflows have been employed.

To contribute or develop your own code based on BiaPy, please follow the guidelines on the `"How to contribute" <contribute.html>`__ section.
